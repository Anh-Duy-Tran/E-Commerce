My E-Commerce Web App using React.js and Node.js
-

*under-development*

**Introduction**


This is my MERN stack e-commerce web application on GitHub. I've used MongoDB to store all the users and products data, React for the responsive front-end, Node.js for the back-end and Express for routing. Security is priority and I've implemented bcrypt for user authentication and JWT for authorization. This project demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack web application that is good looking, efficient and secure. Take a look and let me know what you think

**Progress so far:**
* Mostly working frontend with responsive UI.

**Todo**
* Save user shopping cart to the database.
* More functionalities for the admin user.
