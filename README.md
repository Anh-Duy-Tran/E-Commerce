<h1>MERN E-Commerce Web App</h1>

*under-development*

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is my MERN stack e-commerce web application on GitHub. I've used MongoDB to store all the users and products data, React for the responsive front-end, Node.js for the back-end and Express for routing. Security is priority and I've implemented bcrypt for user authentication and JWT for authorization. This project demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack web application that is good looking, efficient and secure. Take a look and let me know what you think
