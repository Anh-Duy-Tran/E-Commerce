#MERN E-Commerce Web App

*under-development*

##Introduction

This is my MERN stack e-commerce web application on GitHub. I've used MongoDB to store all the users and products data, React for the responsive front-end, Node.js for the back-end and Express for routing. Security is priority and I've implemented bcrypt for user authentication and JWT for authorization. This project demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack web application that is good looking, efficient and secure. Take a look and let me know what you think

##Current state of the project

**Progress so far:**
* Stable backend
* Mostly working frontend with responsive UI for both customer and admin usecase.

**Todo**
* Save user shopping cart to the database.

###Customer usecase:
*DEMO (old version)*

###Admin usecase
* **Login credential:**
*username: admin*
*password: admin12345*
<br>

### After login using the admin credential, the navigating menu will have two more option for the admin user:

* **Edit products (includes add new product to the database, delete or modify the price of existing products)**


* **View and update information (role) of registered users**
